The societies are highly active and more practical knowledge is imparted by these societies rather than the classrooms of SRCC.\r\n\r\nAdmission is through the CUET UG examination and the General Cutoff for 2024 was 782/800. The admission experience isn't very pleasant because NTA conducts the exam but the University has a good mechanism for admission and I truly appreciate its efforts in streamlining admissions",

But my main goal was Delhi university. \nDelhi university includes all the best colleges of india and being a government everyone opt for it. \nSrcc has the highest cuttoff and is known for its best placements and is the best college of asia for commerce hence i choose this above every college.\n\n\nNo i didnt get any rejection from any college because one first preference was only sri ram college of commerce and i got into it.\n\nFor getting into srcc delhi university i had to give exam called cuet ug. \nAs i wanted to do bcom hons i had to give my exams for 4 subjects \n1- Accounts/applied maths/ core maths ( any one ) \n2- business studies \n3- English \n4- Economics ( or any other subject which you have learnt in 11th 12th eg physical education etc)\n\n\nThe first cuttoff score was 782 and it drops a bit as the rounds proceeds.\nThe overall exam giving of cuet was tiring as there was no proper management done during exams. \nThe exam marks were also so delayed so it was quite tiring waiting for the results",

This everyone had studied in their school which is so basic that the ones who have not studied would also know. So its more of a waste of time as we have to attend the classes just because of thw attendance.\n\nThe class test was conducted of 24 marks which included 3 questions of 12 marks each and you have to attempt any 2 \nTiming was of 1 hr ",

I also got know that not only this is one the hardest courses in Delhi University, but also one of the most rewarding courses, providing very high placements. The faculty:student ratio of Shri Ram College of Commerce is around 1:50. All the faculty of Shri Ram College of Commerce is highly qualified with many teachers having more than 30 years of experience in teaching. Although, our session started really late, the term exams were pretty much on time.",

It is quite a tedious process to register for the hostel as they require many things. Hostel is alloted on the basis of your marks. \r\nHostel is very affordable compared to a PG or flat outside college. It takes less than 5 minutes to reach the classroom from hostel. \r\nThe menu of the mess keeps on changing every few weeks and and quality of the food is actually pretty good compared to the image people have for hostel mess food.",

Unlike the procedure followed earlier of releasing the cutoff, DU has followed a new procedure of CSAS (Common Seat Allocation System) for allocating seats to the applicants. Under this system, the cutoff is not released, rather, one has to make a preference list of their courses and colleges and a combination is allocated according to their marks. I got admitted in DU through Scheduled Caste Reservation. The CUET exam can be made better by making it a more streamlined process and conducting exams in the given schedule only.

The college follows the same curriculum are other DU colleges. One thing is that the syllabus is too vast compared to the semester duration, so often teachers are unable to cover it in class. The finance syllabus is closely linked to the CFA syllabus so that is an added advantage. ",

About 50% of the total students are able to secure placements. However, due to the college alumni network and brand name, everyone can secure a job externally as well. I am planning on giving CAT and securing admission to IIM to pursue MBA, as are many of my peers. Others are planning to do CA or UPSC.",

The college library is automated with computer check in and check out with wide availability of all kinds of books( even fiction and philosophy). So extracurriculars can be done by joining the respective societies (Dramatics, Dance, Fine arts) and sports is managed by the sports committee. Trials are held for all sports for the freshers.",

G.B.O and shared a few pros and cons of the program she experienced throughout her program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You get to associate yourself with the well-established SRCC brand name. The top companies safe well aware of this brand and flock here for placements.</li>\r\n\t<li>SRCC has excellent infrastructural facilities some of which include a PA system, a projector, and centralized air-conditioning.</li>\r\n\t<li>SRCC has a massive sports complex that was made for the commonwealth games. It has top-notch facilities like athletes&rsquo; changing rooms, a gymnasium, and much more.</li>\r\n\t<li>GBO has a highly qualified and learned faculty pool. The majority of the professors are alumni of top institutes like IIMs and FMS.</li>\r\n\t<li>Baking affiliated with Delhi University, SRCC shared many core professors with the FMS.</li>\r\n\t<li>The placement scenario is great and some top recruiters include EY, Dell, HCL, Novartis, Baxter, DCM, etc. Some companies visiting FMS allow SRCC students to sit for placements.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>GBO is not an MBA but a Post Graduate Diploma in G.B.O.</li>\r\n\t<li>SRCC is famous for its UG courses so the P.G.D.G.B.O. Program is yet to receive recognition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing I can comment on about DTU DSM is that the crowd quality is poor because of low cutoffs. Placements-wise too, DTU DSM takes the lead while SRCC takes the backseat.</p>\r\n</div>\n",
