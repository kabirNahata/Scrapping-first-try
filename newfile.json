Admission is facillitated through the CAT score,with the exam taking place in the month of November every year. Application forms are available from August. Applicants can apply for all IIMs ,including IIM Shillong through CAT form. \r\n\r\nAs a General category candidate, I did not avail any reservation benefits. Notably , IIM shillong assigns a 15% weightage to work experience , and my direct offer was based on an evaluation of 85%. It's worth mentioning that freshers may need to invest additional effort in the GD and PI processes at IIM Shillong. Interestingly , IIM Shillong uniquely conducts GD before PI , unlike other IIMs.",

My rationale behind choosing PGP course of IIM Shillong was it being a general course ,without any specialisation. It gives opportunity to explore all fields of management like Marketing, Analytics , Operations ,HR , Consulting etc, and didn't restrict your career scope to one specialisation. \r\n\r\nThere are in total 42 faculty members for PGP core course ,evenly covering all domains of studies. Additionally ,in each trimester college keep on inviting guest faculties as well. All faculties have done Phd in their fields , which clearly reflects in their teaching style. \r\n\r\nIIM Shillong conduct 3 trimesters each year. Academics become pretty tough ,if a student is not good at time management accommodating with stress. IIM Shillong is pretty hectic and tough in terms of exams and academics.",

The second stage involves the creation of a final merit list based on the candidates' performance in the WSAT, PI, and other relevant factors such as their GMAT scores, scholastic performance, and work experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overseas candidates will also go through a similar process, with the Admissions Committee carefully reviewing their applications and shortlisting those who meet the necessary criteria. These candidates will then be invited to take the WSAT and participate in a PI, which may be held in one of four cities in India or conducted remotely via video conferencing. The final selection of candidates is based on their performance in the WSAT, PI, and the criteria used for shortlisting them for the PI. Tentative offers of admission will be made by the end of April, and registration for the PGP program is tentatively scheduled for the first week of July at the IIM Shillong campus.</p>\r\n</div>\n",

IIM Shillong is a relatively newer IIM, having been established in 2007, while the older IIMs have been in existence for much longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of comparison, IIM Shillong can be considered on par with IIM Indore and IIM Kozhikode, as IIM Ahmedabad is far ahead in terms of reputation. While the companies that visit Shillong also visit Indore and Kozhikode, these campuses have their own set of marquee recruiters that Shillong has not yet been able to attract, such as TAS, HUL, BCG, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to NIRF rankings, IIM Shillong is ranked 26th. However, rankings should not be the only factor considered when evaluating a business school. There are many other factors that contribute to the quality of a college, and it is important to consider other factors such as curriculum, faculty, industry connections, and alumni network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IIM Shillong has a strong focus on research and has partnerships with several international universities and organizations. It also has a diverse student body and a strong alumni network. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide which business school is the best fit for their goals and needs. IIM Shillong may be behind IIM Indore and IIM Kozhikode in some areas but is likely to grow and narrow the gap in the coming years.</p>\r\n</div>\n",

No matter how good a new IIM is doing, it can never compare to an older established IIM. The same is the case here. IIM Trichy and IIM Udaipur are indeed growing at an excellent rate, but IIM Shillong still is the winner of the race. This is because of its early establishment and being a member of the top IIMs family BLACKIS. That in itself is an accomplishment that the new IIMs have failed to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IIM Shillong is the 7th IIM and is among the top B Schools in India. Ever since its establishment, it has been growing at a tremendous pace and its placements are a testament to that.

Each individual Indian Institute of Management (IIM) now has its own distinct brand value and perception, and the word after the \"IIM\" tag is what will truly matter. For example, IIM Ahmedabad will have a different brand value from IIM Lucknow, which will be different from IIM Kozhikode or IIM Shillong, and so on. With the expansion of the IIM network, with a goal of having an IIM in every state, it may become less meaningful to be accepted into an IIM in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, older business schools tend to have more and better opportunities than IIFT due to their larger alumni networks and longer histories of the establishment. Additionally, business schools located in metropolitan areas may have better accessibility for recruiters, leading to more favorable placements for students.</p>\r\n</div>\n",

However, this is not necessarily the case. In reality, many of the same companies that visit other top business schools like the Indian Institutes of Management in Bangalore and Kolkata also visit IIM Shillong. Additionally, companies come to the North East region to recruit both technical and managerial talent from IIM Shillong, as well as other top schools like IIT Guwahati and IIT Kharagpur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another perception is that IIM Shillong lacks proper infrastructure due to its temporary campus. However, the current campus, which has been in operation for the past 10 years, is equipped with the latest technologies and is on par with other top business schools in terms of infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third perception is that IIM Shillong has poor-quality students and faculty. However, this is not true. In reality, students who are accepted to IIM Shillong have typically scored very highly on the Common Admission Test (CAT), with a percentile score above 98%. Additionally, the business school has guest faculty from reputable colleges abroad who teach a number of elective courses that rotate across the major IIMs. Overall, these factors suggest that IIM Shillong is a high-quality business school that offers a strong education and a range of opportunities for its students.</p>\r\n</div>\n",

The 2022 placement drive had an average CTC of INR 26.65 LPA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MDI offers the best placement in the finance domain after IIM A, B, C, FMS, and XLRI.

It is important to understand that placements are entirely student-driven and depend on the individual's efforts and abilities. Many PGPEX programs at IIMs have a significant number of students from IT services, and these students may not be as diversified or knowledgeable about other industry segments. This can create a gap between the companies and the students and may result in a lower placement rate for some students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, many students who enroll in PGPEX programs do so based on their academic profiles or high scores on entrance exams, rather than their knowledge or experience in other industries. As a result, students who come from non-IT backgrounds may be more successful in securing placements due to their diverse understanding of general management. This is a common issue at all IIMs, and even IIM-L and IIM-I are taking steps to reduce these risks.</p>\r\n</div>\n",

This was a few years back. He wanted to join the course because he felt it would be beneficial for his corporate career. The teaching model at IIM Shillong focuses on developing Asian economies like China. The PGPEX is comparatively affordable at IIM Shillong, compared to other management schools. But the top management schools host international teachers as visiting faculty for their courses. Now here is the catch. The placements of IIM Shillong are entirely student driven. My brother reached out to a faculty member who was clear that the college offers its students a platform, but it can&rsquo;t guarantee placements. During placements your entire profile will get you an offer, not just your &lsquo;IIM Shillong&rsquo; tag.

The second stage involves the creation of a final merit list based on the candidates' performance in the WSAT, PI, and other relevant factors such as their GMAT scores, scholastic performance, and work experience. Overseas candidates will also go through a similar process, with the Admissions Committee carefully reviewing their applications and shortlisting those who meet the necessary criteria. These candidates will then be invited to take the WSAT and participate in a PI, which may be held in one of four cities in India or conducted remotely via video conferencing. The final selection of candidates is based on their performance in the WSAT, PI, and the criteria used for shortlisting them for the PI. Tentative offers of admission will be made by the end of April, and registration for the PGP program is tentatively scheduled for the first week of July at the IIM Shillong campus.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Which one is better PGP-HRM MDI, MBA-core NMIMS, or IIM Shillong?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"If you're interested in PGP HRM, IIM Shillong is the best option in India in terms of placements. The average placement at MDI Gurgaon this year was INR 23.80 LPA, with a median package of INR 23.50 LPA and the highest package of INR 35.57 LPA. Top recruiters included Asian Paints, Infoedge India Limited, Axis Bank, Microsoft, Godrej, KPMG, HCL, Deloitte, Samsung, Google, Amazon, and Atlassian. At NMIMS, Mumbai, the MBA HR program had an average salary of INR 19.40 L, with more than 180 companies participating. The highest salary this year was INR 57.65 L for the MBA Core program and INR 29.09 L for the HR cohort. Notable recruiters included EXL Acumen, J&amp;J Quest, M&amp;MI Rise for Good, PVMI - Make a dent, Reliance T.U.P, Godrej Loud, and more. IIM Shillong's 2022 placements drive saw 100% of students placed for the PGP 2020-22 batch. The highest package for IIM Shillong placements in 2022 was INR 55.22 LPA, while the average package offered was INR 23.10 LPA. PGP HR saw participation from companies like Bosch, D.E. Shaw, HSBC Bank, Mahindra Logistics, Paytm, and Titan, which offered prominent roles in various sectors. IIM Shillong has a smaller batch size compared to NMIMS Mumbai and MDI Gurgaon. MDI Gurgaon and NMIMS have stronger industry and alumni connections compared to IIM Shillong, and they also benefit from their location. IIM Shillong has a strong brand value, but other than that, MDI Gurgaon is the best choice for MBA in HRM, followed by XLRI, IIM Ranchi, SCMHRD, and IMI Delhi.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"How good is IIM Shillong as compared to IIFT Delhi?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"It is true that IIFT Delhi has a strong reputation and a good placement record. Over the past three years, students have consistently earned an average salary package of INR 20 LPA or higher. In the latest placement drive for the 2020-22 batch of the MBA (IB) program, IIFT Delhi achieved 100% placements with 82 companies participating. The highest international CTC was INR 80 LPA, the highest domestic CTC was INR 46.5 LPA, and the average CTC was INR 25.16 LPA. Approximately 25% of the students were placed in the consulting domain. When choosing a business school, it's important to consider factors such as placements, alumni support, exposure to the industry, and available resources like libraries and research papers. Location can also be a factor, as being in Delhi may provide more opportunities for exploration and connection with potential employers compared to Shillong. Ultimately, it's important to weigh all of these factors and choose the school that best meets your needs and goals.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"How does IIM Shillong compare to the older IIMs?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"It is difficult to make a direct comparison between IIM Shillong and the older IIMs, as they have different histories and areas of focus. IIM Shillong is a relatively newer IIM, having been established in 2007, while the older IIMs have been in existence for much longer. In terms of comparison, IIM Shillong can be considered on par with IIM Indore and IIM Kozhikode, as IIM Ahmedabad is far ahead in terms of reputation. While the companies that visit Shillong also visit Indore and Kozhikode, these campuses have their own set of marquee recruiters that Shillong has not yet been able to attract, such as TAS, HUL, BCG, and others. According to NIRF rankings, IIM Shillong is ranked 26th. However, rankings should not be the only factor considered when evaluating a business school. There are many other factors that contribute to the quality of a college, and it is important to consider other factors such as curriculum, faculty, industry connections, and alumni network. IIM Shillong has a strong focus on research and has partnerships with several international universities and organizations. It also has a diverse student body and a strong alumni network. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide which business school is the best fit for their goals and needs. IIM Shillong may be behind IIM Indore and IIM Kozhikode in some areas but is likely to grow and narrow the gap in the coming years.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Which IIM is better: IIM Shillong, IIM Udaipur, or IIM Trichy?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"I don&rsquo;t see why people keep comparing the older IIMs to newer ones. No matter how good a new IIM is doing, it can never compare to an older established IIM. The same is the case here. IIM Trichy and IIM Udaipur are indeed growing at an excellent rate, but IIM Shillong still is the winner of the race. This is because of its early establishment and being a member of the top IIMs family BLACKIS. That in itself is an accomplishment that the new IIMs have failed to achieve. IIM Shillong is the 7th IIM and is among the top B Schools in India. Ever since its establishment, it has been growing at a tremendous pace and its placements are a testament to that. The brand value it enjoys because of being a part of BLACKIS is much more than any new IIM. This brand value helps you in the long run.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Which one should I join, IIM Shillong vs IIFT Kolkata (Delhi possible)?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"You should choose IIFT. Here are the reasons why. IIFT brand is more than 50 years old and well recognized in the industry. While IIM Shillong is a new IIM. Except for the IIM tag, the institute isn&rsquo;t much recognized. In the International Business domain, IIFT is widely recognized. The institute has established its name in the niche through research and related assignments. As of now, IIM Shillong hasn&rsquo;t distinguished itself in any domain. If you compare the batch profile of these colleges, you will observe that IIFT has a better batch profile in terms of work experience, UG college, etc. As IIFT is an older B-school, it has a huge alumni network. IIFT is located in metro cities like Kolkata and Delhi. While Shillong has a remote ocation. Due to the locational advantages, students of IIFTrecive better internships and live projects. Due to these factors, IIFT is better than IIM Shillong.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What is the comparison between IIFT and IIM Shillong?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"It is no longer the case that the \\\"IIM\\\" brand carries the same weight for all business schools. Each individual Indian Institute of Management (IIM) now has its own distinct brand value and perception, and the word after the \\\"IIM\\\" tag is what will truly matter. For example, IIM Ahmedabad will have a different brand value from IIM Lucknow, which will be different from IIM Kozhikode or IIM Shillong, and so on. With the expansion of the IIM network, with a goal of having an IIM in every state, it may become less meaningful to be accepted into an IIM in general. Generally speaking, older business schools tend to have more and better opportunities than IIFT due to their larger alumni networks and longer histories of the establishment. Additionally, business schools located in metropolitan areas may have better accessibility for recruiters, leading to more favorable placements for students.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What's the general perception of IIM Shillong?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"There are several general perceptions about IIM Shillong that may be worth addressing in order to provide a more accurate picture of the business school. One perception is that IIM Shillong is located in a remote area and therefore lacks access to the same opportunities as more metropolitan business schools. However, this is not necessarily the case. In reality, many of the same companies that visit other top business schools like the Indian Institutes of Management in Bangalore and Kolkata also visit IIM Shillong. Additionally, companies come to the North East region to recruit both technical and managerial talent from IIM Shillong, as well as other top schools like IIT Guwahati and IIT Kharagpur. Another perception is that IIM Shillong lacks proper infrastructure due to its temporary campus. However, the current campus, which has been in operation for the past 10 years, is equipped with the latest technologies and is on par with other top business schools in terms of infrastructure. A third perception is that IIM Shillong has poor-quality students and faculty. However, this is not true. In reality, students who are accepted to IIM Shillong have typically scored very highly on the Common Admission Test (CAT), with a percentile score above 98%. Additionally, the business school has guest faculty from reputable colleges abroad who teach a number of elective courses that rotate across the major IIMs. Overall, these factors suggest that IIM Shillong is a high-quality business school that offers a strong education and a range of opportunities for its students.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Do IIM Shillong take class 10\\/12 marks into consideration?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"The class 10 and 12th marks are not directly linked to the shortlisting of GD\\/PI and even for Final Selection in IIM Shillong.
